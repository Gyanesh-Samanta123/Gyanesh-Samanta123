I believe in making data mean more through story telling. A few years ago, a data story teller was unknown. I, myself was on the path to be a ML engineer who dived deep into data and got himself into data science. I believe the thought provoking stories that lie behind a dataset is of prime importance.

Data is the new oil, and data driven stories are the automobiles that convert data into meaningful energy for companies. I help build the automobile for your simplicity and growth.
